This is the repository where the katas that I completed on codewars.com are stored.

## What is Codewars?
Codewars is a coding practice website for all programmers where you can learn various programming languages.

## Challenges
All completed challenges can be found here as in the codewars profile. Additionally, in the code of each program there is a link to the content of its task. There is also some test code left in the code for easy testing.

## Don't copy!
Don't use this repository to copy code! Try to solve the problem yourself before you see the solution.
